            <p>
              Madgrades has recently experienced more traffic than usual which increases the cost to run the service.
              In order to support this growth, we are experimenting with running minimal ads on some 
              pages of the website. Our hope is that this will help to keep Madgrades running smoothly and free for our
              users. As always, we welcome all comments and feedback!

                Before you take a class, it can be helpful to know how
                challenging it is for other students, and how it may factor
                into your GPA. Use Madgrades to get a better idea of the
                course before you click the enroll button in the student center.
